To query the count of the number of cities in the `CITY` table that have a population larger than 1,000,000, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS city_count
FROM CITY
WHERE Population > 1000000;
```

### Explanation

1. **`COUNT(*)`**: Counts the number of rows that satisfy the condition.
2. **`FROM CITY`**: Specifies that the query is operating on the `CITY` table.
3. **`WHERE Population > 1000000`**: Filters the rows to only include cities where the `Population` is greater than 1,000,000.
4. **`AS city_count`**: Labels the output as `city_count` for clarity.

### Example Output

If there are 5 cities in the `CITY` table with populations greater than 1,000,000, the output will be:

```
city_count
-----------
5
```

This query provides the number of cities with a population larger than 1,000,000.
