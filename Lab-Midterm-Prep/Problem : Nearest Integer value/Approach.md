To query the average population of all cities in the `CITY` table and round it down to the nearest integer, you can use the following SQL query. This query calculates the average population using the `AVG` function and applies `FLOOR` to round it down.

```sql
SELECT FLOOR(AVG(Population)) AS average_population
FROM CITY;
```

### Explanation

1. **`AVG(Population)`**: Calculates the average population across all cities.
2. **`FLOOR(...)`**: Rounds down the average population to the nearest integer.
3. **`AS average_population`**: Labels the output column as `average_population` for readability.

### Example Output

If the average population across all cities is 123456.78, this query would return:

```
average_population
123456
```

This query will provide the rounded-down average population for all cities in the `CITY` table.
